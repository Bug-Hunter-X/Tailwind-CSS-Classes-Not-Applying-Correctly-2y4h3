The solution involves carefully reviewing your Tailwind CSS configuration, checking for conflicting styles, and ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly integrated into your project. This often includes verifying the build process.

Here's a corrected `bugSolution.html` file that demonstrates some potential solutions:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind CSS Example</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">
  <div class="container mx-auto p-4">
    <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Styled Text</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">This paragraph now has the correct styling.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Key changes:**

* Ensuring that the Tailwind CSS CDN link is correctly included in the `<head>` section.
* Using a more robust and explicit class names to ensure clarity and reduce possibility of typos.
* Added a `container` class to centralize the content.
* Added a `bg-gray-100` class to the body to ensure consistent background coloring.
