The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Unstyled Text</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This paragraph should have a dark gray color.</p>
</div>
```

The expected output is a styled div with a light gray background, padding, rounded corners, shadow, a dark gray heading, and a paragraph. However, the styles might not be applied, resulting in the default browser styles being shown.
