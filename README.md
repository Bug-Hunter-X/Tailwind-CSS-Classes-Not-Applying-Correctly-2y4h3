# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: the unexpected failure of classes to apply styling to HTML elements.  The `bug.html` file shows the problem. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.html`.

## Problem

In `bug.html`, the Tailwind CSS classes are correctly included; however, the styling does not render on the elements as expected. This could be due to various reasons, including:

* **Incorrect configuration:** The Tailwind CSS configuration might be missing or incomplete, preventing proper compilation or linking.
* **Conflicting styles:** Other CSS rules might override the Tailwind CSS styles.
* **Missing dependencies:** Necessary dependencies or plugins may not be correctly installed or linked.
* **Typographical errors:** Simple typos in class names can easily lead to styling issues.
* **Incorrect build process:** If using a build process (like Vite or Webpack), the Tailwind CSS build process might not be correctly configured or executed.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file presents a corrected version that addresses these potential problems.  The specific solution will depend on the identified root cause.  This could involve checking your Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js` or similar), verifying that other CSS doesn't overwrite Tailwind styles, ensuring that your project's build process correctly processes Tailwind directives, or meticulously examining the HTML for typos in class names.

This example is designed to illustrate a common problem and provide a general approach to debugging similar situations.  The specific solution will vary depending on the context of your project.
